        <strong>A Sound-Bubble-Ink Installation</strong>
        <br></br>
        <p>I often find it difficult to express my feelings with precision.
          <br></br>
          Sometimes it's because words are too slow or too heavy. They weigh down the raw sensation itself. Sometimes, in a fleeting moment, it feels like something deep has opened inside you. Your whole body knows what’s happening. But the moment you try to say it out loud, it starts to slip away.
          When I was a child and hadn't yet learned to speak, I could already make breathy sounds, mumble, or blow bubbles. That was a stage before language was shaped by society. It was a pre-linguistic form of expression. My body was trying to reach the world, but I hadn’t found the words yet.
          <br></br>
          This installation is built from that kind of experience. It tries to free language from the burden of needing to make sense.
          In this space, what you say doesn't matter. Your voice is not translated, interpreted, or recorded. It simply triggers the creation of a bubble. Inside the bubble is ink, a symbolic structure of language, a brief illusion of form. The bubble eventually bursts, and the ink falls onto the fabric.
          Language disappears. A trace remains.
          <br></br>
          Here, sound no longer carries meaning. It only initiates something. The bubble is a phantom of language. The ink mark is what remains after language collapses.
          Language never quite arrives. But the trace has already fallen.
          <br></br>
          It is not a something, but not a nothing either. — Ludwig Wittgenstein<p>
